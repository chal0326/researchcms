In 2025, he exited the \"neutral\" regulator role directly into **JD Vance's** staff.\n*   **Shana Broussard (The Swing Vote):** A Democrat who voted *with* Republicans to block dark money probes. Her reward? The Chairmanship itself in 2024, handed to her by the very Republicans she aided.\n*   **Allen Dickerson (The Revolving Door):** Moved from the *Institute for Free Speech* (defending dark money) to the FEC (regulating it), and then *back* to the Institute.\n\n### The Judicial Payoff\n**Leonard Leo** didn't just pick judges. He monetized the process.\nHis for-profit firm, **CRC Advisors**, collected over **$50 million** from the non-profits he controlled (The 85 Fund, Concord Fund).\nHe turned the Supreme Court nomination process into a personal revenue stream.\n\n### The Election Payoff\n**Gina Swoboda** went from running the dark-money funded **VoteRef** to a taxpayer-funded government position advising on election policy.\n**Heather Honey** moved from generating false election conspiracies to a DHS appointment.\n\nThe Machine didn't just win.
